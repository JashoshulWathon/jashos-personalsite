<h2>Success and evolution</h2>
<p>
Cloud Decor will be a game changer of the Harisson Gil workflow, assets of the product keep on saved even the oldest version, so the accident of losing an asset of the product could be minimized or even doesn't even exist anymore. 
While managing a product could be a lot easier because there is the product master which all the data of the products is centralized and synchronized.
